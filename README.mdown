# RGB LED Controller
### This is a technical doodle

While playing around with RGB LEDs on my Arduino I started to find that delays()
were popping up in methods outside of the main loop().  This was really apparent
in code responsible for fading an LED or a specific color on an RGB.  I needed a way
to manage these transitions without blocking outside of the loop.  That's where this
doodle came in.  It's a small class to maintain the current and last state of the pin
as well as calculate the future step.
